## APPROACH 
In order to arrive at the need solution. I break the problem into pieces and create Jiras using the atlassian Jira. 

First, I ensured I get my responsiveness right using Tailwind CSS grid and screen break point for small and large screen. 

I then break my code base into pieces making use of components. I implement the header component following by the results components and the footer component. I then break and consume the results in the results component using the thumbnail component. Each pokemon is held in the thumbnail component. 

Finally, I consume the pokemon API by by fetching 1000 Pokemon's and using react Paginate to break the results into 16 per page. Anytime the next button is click, the detail of the pokemon is fetching in the thumbnail component. 

On a click of of a pokemon, the detail of the pokemon is display making use of next js page parameter display.

 The details of a pokemon is also break into three components namely the basics for the basic pokemon info, Stats for the pokemon stats making use of react tailwind material progress bar, a free material package from creative teams and the moves component which display all the moves of a pokemon.
 
  I finally implement the search logic and display the search bar at the appropriate page. The implementation of the search was bit challenging though it work as suppose with the need for some improvement if possible.
  
   The search work when three letters a pokemon name is enter but when the letters are clear, it return the first page and not the state of the user assuming the user is on the ten's page. I am not sure if this requirement is exactly what is expected but much improvement will be added if there are more time.
